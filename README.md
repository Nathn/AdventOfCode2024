These are my scripts for each day of the **[2024 edition of Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/)**.

The algorithms are first designed in pseudocode and then implemented in __Python__.

Each day's folder contains:
- One or more small input files called `mininput.txt`
- A main input file called `input.txt` (used by default)
- Two Python scripts, `P1.py` and `P2.py`, which use the input file to solve the day's problems

> [!WARNING]
> The code present in this repository is **not** meant to be *documented*, *optimized* or, to put it simply, ***good***.
> I make these rapidly in the morning and do not take the time to write good code.
> Please do not take this as a prime example of my work, [I can do better](https://github.com/Nathn/AREA).
