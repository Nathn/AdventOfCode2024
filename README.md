My scripts for each day of the [2024 edition of Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/).

The algorithms are first designed in pseudocode and then implemented in Python.

Each day contains:
- one or multiple small input files called `mininput.txt`,
- one big input file called `input.txt` (used by default),
- two Python scripts `P1.py` & `P2.py`, using the input file to solve today's problems.
